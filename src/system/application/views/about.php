<p>"Behind every great company are great people..." or so it is said. That's something that we believe here. This company is about <i>the people</i>. That's you as well as us. Another sign of a great company is <i>faces</i>, not numbers. That said, read on to meet some of the great people (we said they're great already, right?) that will be working on the requests you send in.</p>

<h3>About Marquis</h3>
<p>This is normally the part where I say something like:</p>
<p class="quote">I'm super professional and I've been doing this stuff for years which makes me amazing and so you should spend money - and lots of it - <i>here</i>.</p>
<p>Well, something like that.</p>

<p>I'm not quite that cool, though. I just like good design, standard-compliant code, and making things easier for my users to... well.... use. I'm a little OCD about things like fonts and sizes and screen resolutions and the number of pixels between paragraphs and line-height values and why someone would think that red-on-purple as an outfit or design concept was ever a good idea.</p>

<p>In sum, I'm a bit more of a designer that knows a lot of other cool stuff.</p> <p>When I'm not working on this stuff, there are a few other things I enjoy like art, photography, exercise, martial arts, foreign languages (did I mention I like japanese? No? Okay, I like japanese... a lot. I know French and Spanish, too), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Revolution" target="_blank" alt="Dance Dance Revolution">DDR</a> and video games.</p>
