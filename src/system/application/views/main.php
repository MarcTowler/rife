                        In a market driven by interactivity and functionality, clients can often be overwhelmed with the amount of 
                        features and technologies they are asked to choose from from flash to AJAX and many other things in-between. 
                        In Design Develop Realize, we believe that less is more. Starting with a minimalist view to the project, we 
                        build based on what <strong>you</strong> want, not what costs the most. By looking at design and development 
                        in this manner, we keep the speed of the website super fast as well as bringing a refreshing new breed of 
                        design to the professional world.
